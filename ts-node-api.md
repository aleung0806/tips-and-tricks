# Typescript Node REST API Boilerplate

This is a template for building a REST API using Node, Express and Mongodb.

### Features
#### **Validation** with [zod](). 

Zod allows run-time type checking and compile-time type-checking from the same schema by letting you infer a Typescript type from a Zod schema. 


#### **Authentication** with [passport]() 
This server comes with ```passport-local```, ```passport-google-oauth20``` and ```passport-github2```.

#### **Authorization**  with configurable role-based or action-based permissions 


#### **Session caching** with [redis]() 
#### **NoSQL database** with [mongodb]() and [mongoose]() 
#### **OpenAPI documentation** with [swagger-ui-express]() 
#### **Logging** with [winston]() and [morgan]() 
#### **Code quality** with [prettier]() and [eslint]()
#### **Docker support**

### To start:

1. Install dependences with ```npm install```.
2. Change the ```.env```.   If using Google OAuth2.0 or Github OAuth, register your app with their API and update the ```.env```. These are the default values:
  ```
  PORT=3001
  DOMAIN=http://localhost:3000
  SERVER_DOMAIN=http://localhost:3001
  SESSION_SECRET=1234

  MONGO_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/node-boilerplate
  REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

  GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=1234
  GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=1234

  GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=1234
  GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=1234
  ```


3. Make sure ```mongo``` and ```redis``` are installed and running and listening to the right ports.
2. Run server with ```npm start```.

### Run in a Docker container
1. Build with ```docker build . -t <image-tag>```. 
2. Run with ```docker run -p <host-port>:3001 -d <image-tag>```. Choose whatever local port you'd like to map to for ```<host-port>```.

### To add a new resource

1. Write a zod schema for the resource. Infer the type from it. Zod has useful typescript-like utilities like pick and omit.

2. Write your mongoose schema and type it with your type. Extend the mongoose types for statics and methods if need be.

3. Write your routes for your resource in the doc files.









API for User resource

Authentication: 
Authentication is handled by passport. Passport allows the use of multiple authentication strategies. passport-local, google-oauth20, and passport-github2 strategies are used. 

## API Documentation
Go to 'http://localhost:3000/v1/docs' to view the documentation page generated using [swagger]().

### Todo:
- Docker support
- testing with jest

### To investigate:
regex
mongoose guide - model vs doc vs collection etc
instance of, classes, prototype methods, etc
winston logging debug
postman for flows
swagger for autogenerated client
cypress for testing?
